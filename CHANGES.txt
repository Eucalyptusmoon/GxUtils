* Added support for batch import and export of texture mipmap levels.
* Added ability to modify primary, secondary, and tertiary material indices. Modifying material indices also updates the material count accordingly.
* Added option to reload the model viewer after updating material flags.
* Added the ability to define a new material from given flags.
* Added the ability to define a new material from a given texture file.
* Added the ability to import new textures into the TPL.
* Added an icon for the program
* Added the ability to rename meshes in the GMA.
* Added the ability to change the order of meshes in the GMA.
* Added support for high quality bicubic mipmap interpolation, and made it the default interpolation mode.
* Added support for bicubic interpolation to the command line, and made it the default mode of interpolation.
* Added the ability to export individual or selected groups of models in a GMA/TPL as seperate GMA/TPL files.
* Added the abiltiy to merge two GMA/TPL files by importing the respective textures and models to the currently loaded GMA/TPL.
* Added ability to delete textures from the TPL, and automatically adjust material texture indices to account for the deletion.
* Added ability to clean up a TPL by deleting all unused textures.
* Added display for which models are using which textures in the texture viewer.
* Added ability to define secondary texture coordinates of a mesh from the primary texture coordinates of the mesh.
* Added ability to scale the primary and secondary texture coordinates of a mesh.
* Added option to reload the model viewer to model viewer context menu (updates model with any visible changes)
* Added support for headerless TPLs by generation of a header on file load. Auto-derives header parameters from the file name and size, in the case of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2.
* Added ability to save a TPL without a header by holding shift while saving the TPL file.
* Added ability to translate/change the position of models, as well as translate multiple models at the same time.
* Added ability to copy and paste flags of selected meshes. (experimental)
* Added ability to import more than one texture at a time
* Added ability to remove materials.
* Added ability to duplicate models.
* Added a color selector for the texture viewer's background
* Added an option to toggle between hexadecimal and decimal numbers for material and texture indices
* Fixed exception that might occur when renaming models in the GMA
* Fixed material indices not being properly preserved when multiple meshes are selected with differing indices
* Fixed issue where right-clicking a node doesn't select the node right-clicked on
* Fixed issue where the option to rename would appear when a node is clicked
* Fixed exception when trying to delete unused textures in GMAs with null entries
* Fixed issue where texture coordinate scaling may not apply. Primary and secondary texture scaling now are applied to objects defined in clockwise order, instead of just those in counterclockwise order.
* Fixed tab order of mesh flag editor
* Fixed tab order of model flag editor.
* Fixed typos in the UI.
* Fixed issue where overwriting a GMA or TPL would not update the file size correctly
* Fixed issue where loading a new GMA or TPL while one was already loaded could lead to error messages
* Fixed issue where pressing the Enter or Esc key did not confirm nor close all dialog boxes properly
* Fixed a crash that could occur when a mesh was given an invalid material index
* Fixed a crash that could occur when an OBJ was imported with no map_Kd element in the MTL.
* Fixed a typo in the command line arguments (fxero instead of fzero)
* Changed default material flags to 0x07D4 instead of 0x0000.
* Changed references to materials and texture IDs such that they are universally referenced to in terms of hexadecimal.
* Changed the labelling of the mipmap count such that it starts from 1 universally.
* Changed all references to 'texture coordinate' to 'UV map' for clarification.
